This code is for our TIP paper: 

Wangmeng Zuo, Lei Zhang, Chunwei Song, David Zhang, Huijun Gao,
"Gradient Histogram Estimation and Preservation for Texture Enhanced Image Denoising,"
to appear, IEEE TIP.


Please run "Denoising_Main.m" to show the demo of our algorithm.


Part of the code is from the following work:

W. Dong, L. Zhang, G. Shi and X. Li, "Nonlocally Centralized Sparse Representation for Image Restoration", IEEE Trans. on Image Processing, vol. 22, no. 4, pp. 1620-1630, Apr. 2013.

We also thank Rody Oldenhuis for sharing his codes of bounded Nelder-Mead algorithm ("http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24298-optimize"), which is used by us in estimating the latent noiseless image gradient histogram.
